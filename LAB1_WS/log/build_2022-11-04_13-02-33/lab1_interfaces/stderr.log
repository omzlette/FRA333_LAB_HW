CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /home/omzlette/gitROS/FRA333_LAB_HW/LAB1_WS/build/lab1_interfaces/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /home/omzlette/gitRos/LAB1_WS/build/lab1_interfaces where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "/home/omzlette/gitROS/FRA333_LAB_HW/LAB1_WS/src/lab1_interfaces/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "/home/omzlette/gitRos/LAB1_WS/src/lab1_interfaces/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
